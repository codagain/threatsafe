Started as a college project, 'threatsafe' can now be utilised by the tech community as a good learning resource. Get some hands on experience on a prebiult website and the source code utilizing Folium(a pyhton package)
to make interactive maps to calculate and display threat zones of an explosion(particularly in a refinery). 

It is highly recommended to go through the documentation (https://codagain.github.io/threatsafe/documentation.html) of this project before modifying the source code.

Any concern about the programs can be shared with developers through the contacts given on https://codagain.github.io/threatsafe/
